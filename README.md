# imageInliner (convert image pixels into HTML tags) 
Converts images to HTML Tables, or css box shadows. Can be used for inlining images in emails.

Embedding images in emails can be problematic. Email clients (native or otherwise) like Gmail, Outlook etc will strip them out. 
However, if you convert the image to HTML i.e. take the actual pixels and encode them as HTML elements, the "images" will be rendered by all clients.
